                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the FlexGen Cookbook. It will walk you through the steps needed to
                    generate a map with the FlexGen library, using samples from the example
                    application. The example application is included in the "example" directory in
                    the FlexGen release.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Map Units
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Map units are the basic building blocks of maps and are the smallest element
                    present in a map. They represent the fundamental elements that will compose your
                    map. In the example application, a map is generated that has rivers cutting
                    through grassland. The map units in the example application are grass and river.
                    Each map unit in your map must have a unique name, as the name is used to
                    differentiate one map unit from another. Map units can be constructed as in the
                    following example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapUnit grass = new MapUnit( "Grass" );
    MapUnit river = new MapUnit( "River" );
                </pre>
                <h2>
                    Map Tiles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Map tiles are the key element in maps. You must define several map tile types
                    that will be used to create your map. Maps are generated by randomly selecting a
                    map tile type and then placing a map tile of the specified type in a randomly
                    selected empty location and orientation. A particular location and orientation
                    can only be considered where the four edges of the selected map tile type match
                    the corresponding edges of map tiles adjacent to the location. This process is
                    repeated until there are no empty locations remaining in the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A map tile type is comprised of a two-dimensional grid of map units that define
                    the map tile type. Map tile types also have a unique name (to identify them),
                    a weight (to make some map tile types more likely to be selected than others),
                    an array of map tile edges defining the four edges of the map tile type (the
                    edges are specified in the following order: top, right, bottom left), and an
                    array of map tile orientations defining the distinct orientations available for
                    the map tile type. While you can use any size for the two-dimensional grid of
                    map units, the grid must be the same size vertically as it is horizontally.
                    Also, every map tile type must have the same size grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The example application uses six different tile types. They represent various
                    combinations of the grass and river map units that can be used to generate a map
                    that has rivers cutting through grassland. The following table gives a graphical
                    representation of these six tile types.

                    The following example demonstrates how to construct the straight river map tile
                    type. Note that the top edge of the map tile type is river, the right edge is
                    grass, the bottom edge is river, and the left edge is grass. Also note that due
                    to the symmetry of the grid of map units, the map tile type has only two
                    distinct orientations.
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapTileType straightRiver = new MapTileType(
            "Straight River", 1000,
            new MapUnit[][]
            {
                { grass, river, grass },
                { grass, river, grass },
                { grass, river, grass }
            },
            new MapTileEdge[]
            {
                riverEdge,
                grassEdge,
                riverEdge,
                grassEdge
            },
            new MapTileOrientation[]
            {
                MapTileOrientation.UPRIGHT,
                MapTileOrientation.CLOCKWISE
            } );
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The following example demonstrates how to construct the corner river map tile
                    type. Note that the top edge of the map tile type is river, the right edge is
                    river, the bottom edge is grass, and the left edge is grass. Also note that due
                    to the lack of symmetry of the grid of map units, the map tile type has all four
                    orientations. Finally, note that the weight of the corner river map tile type is
                    500 while the weight of the straight river map tile type is 1000. That means
                    that the corner river map tile type is half as likely to be selected as the
                    straight river map tile type.
                </p>
