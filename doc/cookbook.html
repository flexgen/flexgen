                <h2>
                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the FlexGen Cookbook. It will walk you through the steps needed to
                    generate a map with the FlexGen library, using samples from the example
                    application. The example application is included in the "example" directory in
                    the FlexGen release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several elements you must define when generating a map: map tiles, map
                    tile edges, and map units. Map tiles are the basic building block of maps. You
                    must define several map tile types that will be used to create your map. Map
                    tile edges define which map tile types may be placed adjacent to another map
                    tile type within the map. Map units are the smallest element present in a map
                    and are used to construct map tiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FlexGen generates maps by randomly selecting a map tile type and then placing a
                    map tile of the specified type in a randomly selected empty location with a
                    random orientation. A particular location and orientation can only be considered
                    where the four edges of the selected map tile type in the particular orientation
                    match the corresponding edges of map tiles adjacent to the particular location.
                    This process is repeated until there are no empty locations remaining in the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Map Units
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Map units represent the fundamental elements that will compose your map. In the
                    example application, a map is generated that has rivers cutting through
                    grassland. The map units in the example application are grass and river. Each
                    map unit in your map must have a unique name, as the name is used to
                    differentiate one map unit from another. Map units can be constructed with the
                    following example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapUnit grass = new MapUnit( "Grass" );
    MapUnit river = new MapUnit( "River" );
                </pre>
                <h2>
                    Map Tile Edges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Map tile edges determine how map tiles may be placed adjacent to each other.
                    Each map tile type will have a map tile edge specified for each of its four
                    edges. When determining whether or not a map tile can be placed adjacent to
                    another map tile, the edges connecting both of the map tiles must match. For
                    example, if a map tile is being placed on top of another map tile, the bottom
                    edge of the new map tile must match the top edge of the existing map tile. If a
                    map tile is being placed adjacent to more than one map tile, this check is
                    performed for all adjacent tiles. The map tile edges in the example application
                    define an edge that is made up entirely of grass and an edge with a river
                    flowing through the middle. Each map tile edge in your map must have a unique
                    name, as the name is used to differentiate one map tile edge from another. Map
                    tile edges can be constructed with the following example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapTileEdge grassEdge = new MapTileEdge( "Grass Edge" );
    MapTileEdge riverEdge = new MapTileEdge( "River Edge" );
                </pre>
                <h2>
                    Map Tiles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A map tile type is comprised of a two-dimensional grid of map units that define
                    the map tile type. Map tile types also have a unique name (to identify them),
                    a weight (to make some map tile types more likely to be selected than others),
                    an array of map tile edges defining the four edges of the map tile type, and an
                    array of map tile orientations defining the distinct orientations available for
                    the map tile type. While you can use any size for the two-dimensional grid of
                    map units, the grid must be the same size vertically as it is horizontally.
                    Also, every map tile type must have the same size grid. The map tile edges are
                    specified in the following order: top, right, bottom, left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The example application defines six different tile types. They represent various
                    combinations of the grass and river map units that can be used to generate a map
                    that has rivers cutting through grassland. The following gives a graphical
                    representation of these six map tile types:

                    The following example demonstrates how to construct the straight river map tile
                    type. Note that the top edge of the map tile type is river, the right edge is
                    grass, the bottom edge is river, and the left edge is grass. Also note that due
                    to the symmetry of the grid of map units, the map tile type has only two
                    distinct orientations.
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapTileType straightRiver = new MapTileType(
            "Straight River", 1000,
            new MapUnit[][]
            {
                { grass, river, grass },
                { grass, river, grass },
                { grass, river, grass }
            },
            new MapTileEdge[]
            {
                riverEdge,
                grassEdge,
                riverEdge,
                grassEdge
            },
            new MapTileOrientation[]
            {
                MapTileOrientation.UPRIGHT,

                <p>
                    The following example demonstrates how to construct the corner river map tile
                    type. Note that the top edge of the map tile type is river, the right edge is
                    river, the bottom edge is grass, and the left edge is grass. Also note that due
                    to the lack of symmetry of the grid of map units, the map tile type has all four
                    orientations. Finally, note that the weight of the corner river map tile type is
                    500 while the weight of the straight river map tile type is 1000. That means
                    that the corner river map tile type is half as likely to be selected as the
                    straight river map tile type.

                    Generating the Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that all of the elements have been defined, it is time to construct the map
                    generator and generate the map. First, you need a random number generator. You
                    can either use the random number generator included with FlexGen,
                    <code>org.flexgen.util.ImprovedRandom</code>, or use your own. If you use your
                    own random number generator, it must be a sublcass of
                    <code>org.flexgen.util.ImprovedRandom</code>, as that is what the map generator
                    expects. The random number generator can be constructed with the following
                    example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    ImprovedRandom improvedRandom = new ImprovedRandom();
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Next, you need to combine all of your defined map tile types into an array that
                    you will pass to the map generator constructor. The six map tile types from the
                    example application can be combined into an array with the following example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapTileType[] mapTileTypes = new MapTileType[]
    {
        allGrass,
        straightRiver,
        cornerRiver,
        threeWayRiver,
        fourWayRiver,
        deadEndRiver
    };
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Now you need to construct the map generator. The constructor for the map
                    generator takes the random number generator, the array of map tile types, and
                    the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates for the map. The map generator can
                    be constructed with the following example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    MapGenerator mapGenerator = new MapGenerator(
            improvedRandom, mapTileTypes, -10, -10, 10, 10 );
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The final step before generating the map is that you need to add whatever
                    initial map tiles tiles you want to the map. You must add at least one map tile
                    before generating the map. A map tile can be added to the map with the following
                    example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    mapGenerator.addMapTile(
            new MapTileLocation( 0, 0 ),
            new MapTile( allGrass, MapTileOrientation.UPRIGHT ));
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Finally, you can generate the map. A map can be generated with the following
                    example:
                </p>
                <pre>
    mapGenerator.generate();
                </pre>
                <h2>
                    Getting Stuck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Version 1.0.0 of FlexGen has a known issue where the map generator can get
                    "stuck" when generating the map. What this means is that that the map generator
                    can get into a situation where it is impossible to place a map tile in a certain
                    location in the map because no map tile type in any orientation can fit in that
                    location. FlexGen has no logic to deal with this situation, and when it occurs
                    an exception is thrown. To ensure this does not happen, you must define map tile
                    types such that a map tile type exists for every possible combination of map
                    tile edges that may occur in the map. Newer versions of FlexGen will contain
                    logic to solve this problem without requiring you to define map tile types for
                    every combination of map tile edges.
