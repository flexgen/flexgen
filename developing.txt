This file describes everything you need to get started developing on the
FlexGen project. If you are interested in how to use FlexGen in your own
project, this file is not intended for you and you should instead use
the documentation available on the FlexGen web site:

Overview
========

The FlexGen project is switching from Ant to Maven for managing its
build process. Since this process is still ongoing, these instructions
are not complete. These instructions will continue to be updated as the
process proceeds.

If you need any assistance with the instructions in this file, you can
use the FlexGen developers mailing list to get the help you need:
