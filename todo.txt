- Milestone 1:
  - Determine what to do with MapUnit:
    - Do we really need to store a name? Doesn't seem that useful.
      - However, having a name is useful for tests.
      - If we drop name, need to consider what to use for toString().
    - What about storing a color (for when we render the map to an image).
    - Do we need equals() and hashCode() methods?
- Milestone 2:
  - Map examples:
    - Rivers that start in mountains, end in ocean, and don't loop.
    - Towns that are fully connected by roads.
