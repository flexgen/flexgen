Getting FlexGen

    There are multiple methods for getting FlexGen: through
    {{{http://maven.apache.org/} Apache Maven }}, downloading a release from
    {{{http://sourceforge.net/} SourceForge }}, or cloning the FlexGen Git repository from
    {{{https://github.com/} GitHub }} and compiling it yourself.

* Apache Maven

    If you are already using Apache Maven to build your project, adding FlexGen to your project is
    simple.

** Repository

    First, add the FlexGen releases repository to your project's pom.xml:

+--
<repository>
    <id>flexgen-releases</id>
    <url>http://repot.flexgen.org/releases/</url>
</repository>
+--

    If you want to use a snapshot version of FlexGen, add the FlexGen snapshots repository to your
    project's pom.xml instead:

+--
<repository>
    <id>flexgen-snapshots</id>
    <url>http://repot.flexgen.org/snapshots/</url>
</repository>
+--

** Dependency

    Next, add the FlexGen dependency to your project's pom.xml:

+--
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flexgen</groupId>
    <artifactId>flexgen</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--

* SourceForge

    The latest version of FlexGen can be downloaded from the
    {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexgen/files/} SourceForge download page }}.

* GitHub

    FlexGen uses GitHub to host its Git repository. More information about accessing the FlexGen Git
    repository is available on the Maven {{{../source-repository.html} Source Repository }} report.
